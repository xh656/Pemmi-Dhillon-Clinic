            <p class="paragraph">Laser therapies are medical treatments that use focused light. Unlike most light sources, light from a laser (which stands for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation) is tuned to specific wavelengths. also known as laser skin resurfacing, is a procedure that makes use of lasers to improve skin irregularities or remove skin blemishes. This is a good option for people who want to achieve smoother, younger-looking skin. Laser skin treatment is also known as laser vaporization or peel.. In laser skin treatments, the epidermis, or the skin's outer layer, is removed. At the same time, the dermis, which is the layer of the skin underneath the surface, is heated, stimulating the skin cells to produce elastin and collagen fibers. Using lasers for skin treatments results in controlled injury to the damaged skin and promoting wound healing and re-modelling. The healing process creates new skin cells, resulting in a smoother and tighter skin surface.</p>
